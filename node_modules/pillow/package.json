  "readme": "Pillow scans directories for commonJS packages and makes them accessible\nin the browser (the packages are converted to a directory that can\nbe served statically).\n\nPillow can operate from the command line or as a server. When running as\na server it will regenerate everything on the fly (remake the packages\ndepending on what has changed in the source directories).\n\nImages (png, jpg) are also copied to the output folder keeping the original\nfolder hierarchy relative to the package.json to which they belong.\n\nInstallation\n============\nnpm install -g pillow\n\n\nCommand line operation\n======================\nThis assumes the package was installed globally. If not, pillowscan aliases\nto bin/pillowscan.js.\n\n**pillowscan [options] folder1 [folder2..foldern]**\n\nOptions:\n\n**--help**: displays help information\n\n**-jquery=filepath**: includes and integrates jquery using the provided sources\n\n**-only=pathRelativeToDstFolder**: only remakes the specified file\n\n**-cache=packageName,packageName2**: Use http caches for the specified package\n\n**-cacheext=ext1,ext2,ext3**: Use http caches for the specified package\n\n**-css**: Includes all dependent css files in the resulting html\n\n**-html**: Generate a package.html\n\n**-minify**: Minifies js file while packaging them\n\n**-nomake=package1,package2,package3** : Prevents some packages from being\nregenerated\n\n**-port=portnumber**: Uses the specified port in server mode (instead of 1337)\n\n**-work=path**: Working directory (defaults to the current directory).\n\nexample\n-------\n\npillowscan mypackages\n\nWill scan mypackages and its subdirectories and generate or update ./generated\nthat will contain properly packaged sources and assets.\n\n\nServer operation\n================\nThis assumes the package was installed globally. If not, pillowserve aliases\nto bin/pillowserve.js.\n\n**pillowserve [options] folder1 [folder2..foldern]**\n\n(see pillowscan for options)\n\nwill make all packages loadable at:\n\nhttp://localhost:1337/make/packageName/packageName.js\n\nSo you can do:\n\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:1337/make/packageName/packageName.js\n\nLibrary operation\n=================\n\nThe following functions are available from the pillow package:\n\nserve\n\nmakeAll\n\nmakePackage\n\nmakeFile\n\nprocessArgs\n\nfindPackages\n\nThese will be documented later.\n\nStructure of the generated folder\n=================================\n\nThe generated folder will have the following structure:\n\n    generated/\n\n        pillow.js\n\n        package1/\n\n            package1.js\n\n            some/\n\n                subdir/\n\n                    for/\n\n                        images/\n\n                            img1.png\n\nAssuming that img1.png was located at ./some/subdir/for/images/img1.png relative\nto the package.json file.\n\nMore advanced features\n======================\n\nPillow supports many different applicationDomains (each applicationDomain\nbeing able to have his own versions of packages). It also supports loading\nor reloading packages at run time.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 Hugo Windisch\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
