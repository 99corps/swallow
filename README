Swagup is a collection of commonjs packages that implement a graphic model.

The graphic model can be used for supporting DOM graphics, Canvas graphics,
WebGL graphics or any other type of graphics.

A graphic editor (written in swagup) allows to graphically create applications
using swagup components. The editor itself is a swagup component.


--------------
+ the visual model is web agnostic, defines position, events, dirt
+ any component can expose one or more visual elements (through a standard
component interface)

+ stuff like theming can be defined inside a component (example, a UI component
can support theming for all its visuals (listbox, menu, whatever))

+ think about skinning (defining a skin for an existing component)
